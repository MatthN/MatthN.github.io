## The Essential Role of Structure
Imagine the thrill of embarking on a new data science project: the data's potential whispering promises of undiscovered insights and groundbreaking findings. In this initial excitement, it's all too easy to dive headfirst into the sea of data, letting structure and organization fall by the wayside. Yet, as the project evolves, the excitement can quickly turn into a daunting maze of updated datasets and sprawling scripts, transforming enthusiasm into a quest for clarity amidst chaos.

**The pivotal role of structured organization** cannot be overstated. It is the backbone that supports every phase of a project, from inception through to completion. Picture this: you're sailing smoothly on the data exploration journey, only to be redirected by the arrival of updated data. With a structured approach, this is merely a minor course adjustment. However, without it, it's akin to navigating without a compass, where "Data_updated_last_final" becomes a familiar landmark on a map marked by confusion.

In the realm of data science, **efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility** are not merely buzzwords but essential pillars. The meticulous process of preprocessing, tuning, and experimenting, each step carefully recorded and organized, ensures that the project's integrity remains intact. This disciplined approach transforms overwhelming complexity into a well-documented journey, enabling future explorers to retrace steps and build upon previous work with confidence.


## Charting the Course: Effective Project Organization
Embark on your voyage with a well-planned folder structure. Having a clear and standardized directory hierarchy enables you and your collaborators to easily understand what is in the project. Think of adding divisions such as data, code, models, reports, etc. If you are looking for a ready-to-go structure or simply some inspiration then [cookiecutter-data-science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) might be a good starting point.


## Navigating Through Time: The Art of Version Control
Even when working alone on a project I recommend to use a versioning system such as GitHub. Your project is always safely backed up. You can revert back to an older version if needed. Whether you face minor setbacks or catastrophic disasters, version control serves as your beacon, allowing you to restore your work to its former glory. GitHub also enables easy experimentation in a separate branch which you can merge back into main if it turns out successful.


## The Alchemy of Environment Management
In the alchemist's lab that is your project, virtual environments act as crucibles, enabling the creation of isolated realms where magic—specific package versions and dependencies—can be controlled and harnessed. You can create a virtual environment using venv simply by running:

{% highlight powershell %}
python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv
{% endhighlight %}

Then activate your environment like so:

{% highlight powershell %}
c:\path\to\myenv\Scripts\activate.ps1
{% endhighlight %}

You can output the packages installed in your virtual environment to a requirements.txt which can then be used by someone else to install the necessary dependencies.

{% highlight powershell %}
pip freeze -r requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}


## The Labyrinth of Experimentation: Mastering the Maze
In the labyrinth of model experimentation, it's easy to find oneself retracing steps, lost among the myriad paths of algorithms and configurations. In the following I have listed some key things to take into account.

**Avoid code duplication.** This is an easy pitfall when working on a preprocessing pipeline. You write out all preprocessing steps for your training dataset, and then again for your validation dataset. Modifying a step then requires you to make the change in all the places where this step is executed. Instead, work with a proprocessing module that you import in the right places.

I really like the python package [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) in this respect. It enables you to make a pipeline of all your preprocessing steps. This pipeline can be fitted on your training data and then applied to your validation and test set with the fitted parameters. This ensures consistency across datasets, and also avoids data leakage.

**Store your (intermediate) results.** Avoid having to rerun your code constantly to check the results once more. You can store your models using the [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package in python.

{% highlight python %}
import joblib
joblib.dump(my_model, 'my_model.pkl')   # stores the model
my_model = joblib.load('my_model.pkl')  # loads the model
{% endhighlight %}

Do the same for your predictions. I created a postgresql database with a simple data model to store my predictions. This then enabled me to build a simple dashboard in Power BI to compare my models on different metrics. You can drill down into observations with poor predictions and see what sets them aside.

**Document your experiments.** Even though this might seem as overkill at first, there will come a moment that you need to understand again what you already tried.
